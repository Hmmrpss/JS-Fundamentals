7.Treasure Locator

You will be given a series of coordinates, leading to a buried treasure. Use the map to the right to write a program that locates on which island it is. After you find where all the treasure chests are, compose a list and print it on the console. If a chest is not on any of the islands, print “On the bottom of the ocean” to inform your treasure-hunting team to bring diving gear. If the location is on the shore (border) of the island, it’s still considered to lie inside.
The input comes as an array with a variable number of elements that are numbers. Each pair is the coordinates to a buried treasure chest.
The output is a list of the locations of every treasure chest, either the name of an island or “On the bottom of the ocean”, printed on the console.
