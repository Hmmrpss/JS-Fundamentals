19.Quadratic Equation

Write a JS function to solve a quadratic equation by given in standard form as its coefficients: a, b, c. You may learn more about quadratic equations here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/quadratic-equation.html.
The input comes as 3 numbers a, b and c. The value of a will be non-zero.
The output depends on the equation:
•	It holds two numbers x1 and x2 if the equation has two different solutions (roots): x1 and x2.
o	First print the smaller root, then the greater.
•	It holds a single number x if the equation has only one solution (root): x.
•	It holds the text “No” if the equation has no solutions (no real roots).
